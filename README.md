The project is the game Madlibs. The project is similar to how a book for Madlibs would be.

The project is a game that is designed to make the user happy while playing it because of its silliness.
	
This project requires that you know variables, the print statement, and the scanner statement well. You will also need to know how to add the story across several lines.
